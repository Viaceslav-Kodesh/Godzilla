# Godzilla
This service can make it clear the level of resilience of your objects in OpenStack.

## How it works:
Godzilla finds all the virtual machines in your OpenStack project and sorts them into two types “in server group or not” and use reboot type ‘HARD’ and wait for status ‘ACTIVE’ you can control the count of virtual machines and chaos time.

## How to use Godzilla:
Should create new repository on **github.com**

    name: Implement Chaos
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: OpenStack Chaos Action
      uses: Viaceslav-Kodesh/Godzilla@master
      env:
          DELAY: ${{5}}  #minutes
          PERCENT: ${{50}}
          OS_USERNAME: ${{secrets.OS_USERNAME}}
          OS_AUTH_URL: ${{secrets.OS_AUTH_URL}}
          OS_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.OS_PASSWORD}}
          OS_TENANT_NAME: ${{secrets.OS_TENANT_NAME}}
          OS_PROJECT_NAME: ${{secrets.OS_PROJECT_NAME}}
          OS_NOVA_VERSION: ${{secrets.OS_NOVA_VERSION}}
          OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME: ${{secrets.OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME}}
```
